Developed a robust QR code scanner web application using HTML5, JavaScript and cutting-edge QR code libraries, showcasing technical prowess in front-end web development.
Successfully integrated camera access functionalities into the QR code scanner, enabling seamless scanning.

Note: I will soon upload the libraries which I used for the Qr code scanner as I'm not able to upload it now dur to some error.
